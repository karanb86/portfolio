            Hi, I am a Software Engineer who is working specifically in the domain of Web App Development for than
            a year now. I have hands on experience on technologies like Angular2+, ReactJS along with various libraries that can
            be doped with these technologies to enhance the user experience.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In my entire experience of development, I have always tried to write the code as clean as possible.
            According to me, the code quality and readability should be the top notch priority of a developer.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I am looking forward to explore through more of such technologies in the near future.
        </p>
